Telecom,7,"India's telecom market boasts over 1.15 billion mobile connections, categorized into prepaid and postpaid plans. With a majority of connections being prepaid, the telecom industry is highly competitive, allowing customers to switch between service providers. This dynamic has led to a phenomenon known as churn, where customers discontinue services with one operator and move to another. Customer churn, represented by the churn rate, is a significant concern for telecom companies. In this fiercely competitive market, the prepaid churn rate averages around 6% per month, while the postpaid churn rate ranges between 2-3%. 

Given the high cost associated with acquiring new customers, retaining existing ones has become a priority for telecom operators. Retaining high-profitability customers has become the primary business goal for many incumbent operators. To reduce customer churn, operators must accurately predict which customers are at a high risk of churning. Churn prediction systems play a vital role in not only accurately predicting churners but also interpreting customer churn behavior. By identifying at-risk customers, operators can offer targeted incentives, implement effective marketing strategies, and optimize their network assets. Business intelligence is crucial in enabling operators to provide the right incentives in the face of growing competition in the telecommunications market.

Mayank_Handicraft,5,"The Mayank Handicraft is a leading furniture-making company that is currently facing challenges in delivering products to customers within the promised timeframe, resulting in customer dissatisfaction and increased product cancellations. The furniture company is currently facing mounting financial losses due to a convergence of factors, including declining consumer trust, prolonged product delivery times, and a growing work-in-process inventory resulting from increased product cancellations.
 
The primary objective of the furniture company is to address the aforementioned issues and find solutions within its existing resources. The company aims to improve the overall efficiency of its plant operations by identifying and reducing losses related to manpower, machinery, and material wherever possible.
 
To address the challenges and improve overall plant efficiency, the company conducted a thorough analysis of the furniture-making process from raw material purchasing to the final product ready for customer dispatch. During this examination, several issues were identified, with the main issues outlined be
low:
Material Purchasing: Material required for order processing was only purchased once a week, after consolidating all the materials needed for orders throughout the week. This approach caused delays in material availability, as well as challenges in managing inventory effectiv

Unoptimized Use of Existing Software: Software systems, like inventory management and production software tools, were not fully utilized. This resulted in inefficient tracking of materials, poor visibility into production status, and reliance on the manual capabilities of the workforce present on the shop floor.

Manual Transportation of Material between workstations: Manual handling of materials slowed down the production process, increased the risk of errors, and led to additional labor requirements.
Inefficient Maintenance Department leading to increased machine breakdowns and unexpected downtime. Inadequate maintenance protocols and a lack of proactive measures contributed to disruptions in the production flo
